# About The Project
This project contains a custom GPIO driver implementation for STM32 microcontrollers. The driver is designed to provide an easy-to-use interface for configuring and controlling GPIO pins.

## Features
- Configure GPIO pins as input, output, alternate function, or analog mode.
- Set pin output type (push-pull or open-drain).
- Configure pull-up/pull-down resistors.
- Set pin speed (low, medium, high, very high).
- Read pin input state.
- Write pin output state.
- Toggle pin state.

## Prerequisites
- STM32CubeIDE or any compatible IDE
- Basic knowledge of STM32 microcontroller architecture
